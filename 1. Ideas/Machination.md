## Summary
The first half of the game is a lighthearted, satisfying collect/build/upgrade cycle. The player must chop down trees and mine stone and ores to build houses for people to move into. Meanwhile, he is slowly constructing his Machine, the one thing that can help his ailing wife, which requires increasingly esoteric components. No matter how hard it gets, he never gives up on his beloved. 

The machine is finally done. It turns out that the man's wife was dead the whole time. The machine is supposed to bring her back. 

It does. But she's different.

The second half of the game dives straight into horror territory. The entire world you just created is flipped on its head and nobody is safe.
