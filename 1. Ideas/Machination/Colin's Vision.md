*I have made use of internal links here, which I've found to be extremely useful for adding asides and notes without distracting from the main content. You can click on [[Colin's Vision#^preamble|these links]], which will take you to the text block it refers to, but possibly the best way is to simply hover over the link and press "ctrl," which will show a preview window of the text block so you don't have to go back and find your place again.*

## Elevator Pitch
With obligations to a powerful nobleman and an ailing wife, you must do what needs to be done to save her before it's too late. Find, trade, and craft increasingly rare components to build a machine that will heal your wife, all while collecting resources to build structures for the nobleman's newly established town. All seems well until it is revealed that your wife had already passed right before the game began and the trauma caused you to finally crack. All of your efforts led you to the creation of an infernal mechanism which brings your beloved back, at the cost of unleashing demonic forces into her very being. What will you do now?

## The Player's Experience
###### This represents what I believe the ideal player experience to be. Of course, different players will have different experiences, but this is the "goal." I have written it entirely in the second person, blurring the line between player and protagonist to simulate the player's immersion in their role, while only showing what the **player** knows, not what the **protagonist** knows.

You are a renowned medieval woodsman and artificer from a large city who suddenly moved the countryside. Your dearly beloved wife is bedridden, her condition worse still than when you moved in order to help her recover outside of the bustle and noise. You've made a deal with a local nobleman to construct his new settlement: for each new residence or business built, the nobleman [[Colin's Vision#^greedy-nobleman|will pay you]] a specified amount. 

While you are often busy collecting resources and building structures, your real motivation is getting your hands on rare components and materials which are needed to construct the life-saving machine which will save your wife, no matter what anyone thinks about it. Still, it's best if it doesn't come up in [[Colin's Vision#^dialogue-musings|conversation]]. Some components and materials can be found in the mines or in the forest, others can be built if one has the raw resources and knowledge, and some can only be purchased from [[Colin's Vision#^allure-occupations|townspeople with specific occupations]].

As the town grows, you continue to meet new people and interact with those who have settled in. Throughout this time, your resolve to help your wife overcome her ailment is as strong as ever and every night, you talk to her and reassure her, even if she is too weak to respond. Your relationships with your wife and the townspeople strengthen even more.

As the machine nears completion, you start to notice more unusual things. The components you need are increasingly strange, even sinister. You realize that you've still never seen your wife, only the outside of the house and what you've said to her. Still, you try not to think too hard about it and focus on the greater goal. The thought lingers in the back of your mind - *what is actually going on here?*

Finally, you get your hands on the last component needed for the machine. It is almost time. You go home for the night as usual, but this time you finally get to see the inside. There is nobody there, nobody at all. You begin talking to your wife as if everything is normal anyway, and that lingering thought overwhelms you. *What is going on??*

The next day arrives and it is time to power on the machine. You hesitate, now apprehensive 

## Setting
Medieval-ish times on an empty piece of land not too far but not too close to the nearest civilization, where the nobleman who owns the land lives.

## Aesthetics
8x8 pixel art, colorful but slightly desaturated and rich blacks. Red is only ever used for blood.

## ADDENDUM A: Thinking Too Much
What happens if you try to kill a villager? Most of them would die in one hit. You can carry the body around? Bring them to the machine and nothing happens, but if you leave them there and nobody sees you do it then something extra happens when it turns on. ^kill-a-villager

The nobleman is incentivised to pay for new construction because he owns the land and wants to earn taxes from people living on it. ^greedy-nobleman

Maybe you could build things that will allure certain occupations to come to settle down in order to procure certain components if that occupation is not yet present in your town. ^allure-occupations

Not sure how deep the dialogue system should go... Writing takes time and the more response options available, the more there is to write and manage. Mr. ChatGPT does indeed exist but man, I'd be very concerned about the quality. Maybe as a starting point? Anyway, it's probably out of scope to have the dialogue seriously effect the game so idk. This is a discussion for another time. ^dialogue-musings
