## Sub-tasks
- [x] Tool-free (pick up items)
- [ ] Tool (axe a tree, it drops items)
- [ ] Different tools for different resources

## Notes
- should the player have to carry items one at a time? 
	- too realistic, boring and annoying
- should there be a full inventory system?
	- unnecessary, unneeded complexity
- should resources be added to a "pool" automatically on pickup?
	- unrealistic, but simple, and nice for the player
