## Notes
- I'm thinking we really don't need this. I actually think this would make the game feel even more restricted and it would be weird if it like teleported you in the middle of walking around in the woods.
- the only way this works is if there's some kind of energy or tiredness or something, like  [Stardew Valley](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Energy). That would be awesome, but adds complexity.
