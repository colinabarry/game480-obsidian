## Act One

### Story

*The main protagonist will be called P here*

P is a quiet man who moves into the wilderness ___to start a new life___ and to retire in a sense. P has a past of craftsmanship and is a great engineer. P builds a home for him and his wife. P bored in his new life, decides he's going to create a tribute to his wife, an incredible complex machine, as a display of his love. P draws up the blueprint and gets to work. P gathers materials over time, wood, rocks, minerals, and begins construction. 

P, shortly after arriving himself, meets his first new neighbor, their name is Roon! They've moved to their area for the same reason P did, to start a new life and enjoy the abundance of natural resources, so they can start a family. Over time more and more pioneers move into the area and ___over the years___, a village forms. P over the years becomes very close with the villagers and forms a really strong relationship with some of them.

During this time P goes home every night and talks to his wife. About the machine, about the villagers, and about the world around them. *Important Note: The dialog box when talking to his wife is on a black screen, you cannot see him talking to his wife*

P continues construction on the machine. Sometimes the villagers wonder what the machine is meant to do, because P doesn't like to talk about the machine.

### Narrative Goals

To create an emotional connection between the player and P's wife and the villagers

### Gameplay

Very chill gameplay, with vibes similar to animal crossing and stardew valley

I personally feel like a lot of focus in Act One should go into the interactions with the villagers, creating those relationships with them and having the player create a bond with the village and world around them.

I'm personally indifferent about the specifics of the mining gameplay. But the base of it should be a sandbox resource miner simulator, with a satisfying gameplay loop, that doesn't bore the player.

## Act Two

### Story

*This section is more meta than the last*

P, is nearly done with the machine and cannot wait to tell his wife about it! *The player at this point still has no idea what the machine is supposed to do specifically*

P goes home that night and tells his wife that he's almost done *This time, the screen is not black and the player can see the players bedroom, and it's revealed that his wife has never been there and P has been talking to no one the entire time*

*Now the player is both wondering, "What is this machine for, if his wife isn't even a thing" and  "Why has P been talking to no one this entire time"*

The next morning, P puts the finishing touches on the machine and starts it up. Streams of floating blood then spiral around the machine and it begins to crumple a little bit. Then, as quickly as the chaos began, it was over, there is a period of silence.

Then, a woman, wearing a white veil and soaked in blood, floats out of the machine. 

P exclaims "My beloved wife!"

The woman just looks at P and leaves him.

She's walking in the direction of the village...

### Narrative Goals

To serve as a bridge between the first and third acts, a lot of is happening here. The player is realizing his wife has either never existed or is dead. Then there's this almost immediate whiplash with "Well if P's wife never existed, what is the machine for" and then the player finding out soon after that the machine was meant to resurrect his wife from the dead. The player then witnesses P's beloved wife leave him soon after that, despite P's efforts. As well as realizing that this potentially dangerous entity is heading towards the village of people, that the player has been forming a bond with.

## Act Three

### Story

P then follows his wife to the village and sees his wife murdering and eating all of the villagers that P has come to care for. 

P must make a choice, kill his wife or let her destroy the village in order to protect her.

### Narrative Goals

Present the player with the choice of either saving P's wife or saving the villagers, both of whom the player has formed a close connection with throughout the game.
