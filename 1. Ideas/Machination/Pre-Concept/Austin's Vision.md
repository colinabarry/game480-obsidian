<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>The main character &ldquo;P&rdquo; has a dream to make his community a better place. P sets out to accomplish this goal; midway through, P&rsquo;s wife, &ldquo;Q&rdquo;, falls ill. P sets out to build a machine to cure her, balancing the town's needs with the resource demands of the machine. Q dies and P innovates a resurrection upgrade to the machine, but Q&rsquo;s death has left P in a state of madness. When the machine is finishes, Q is revived as an undead demon. Q accuses P of neglecting her for the town and demands the town be purged. P has a choice to make&hellip;</p>
<h1>Story</h1>
<p>The main character &ldquo;P&rdquo; is the mayor of a small town; actually, it is barely a town. A collection of rickety houses in the secluded temperate wilderness is a more accurate description. Though far away, the town is connected to faraway cities via a central road that goes through town.</p>
<p>&nbsp;P is not only the leader of this community, but he is also a genius and engineer. P takes it upon himself to turn the shambletown into a thriving community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>P gathers resources such as wood, stone, and food; then, he upgrades the town and feeds his people. As his town thrives, wanderers may move into empty homes. All villagers, old and new, have names and stories that the player explores by interacting with them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While building his town, P&rsquo;s wife Q falls ill. P knows enough to see it is a serious illness. After days of work, he creates the schematic for a machine that will cure his wife. Over the days and weeks, P builds the machine as well as his town. It is up to P (the player), how many resources goes to the machines construction, and the town.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The relationship of the villagers, and the health of Q depends on where resources are allocated. &frac34; years after the game&rsquo;s start, Q dies of her illness. The trauma and shock of losing Q sends P into a deep depression, all of which is kept unknown to the villagers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A week passes and P emerges slightly cracked. Reality is no longer the same, P&rsquo;s mind has been hit so hard by grief that it falls into madness. Things are no longer what they seem, people appear like ghouls for a moment, P sees apparitions in the edge of his visions, and he hears things that are no longer there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This madness sends P into the final stretch of the machine's construction. He believes that the machine, after his newest innovation, might even heal Q from the dead; even if it requires taboo ingredients like human blood.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A full year after the games start, the machine is complete. P turns it on. The result is a nightmare.</p>
<p>Q is turned into an undead demon. Q insists that it was the village who killed her, that P&rsquo;s neglect of Q as he built the village had led to her demise. The only redemption for P, in the eyes of Q, is that the village be purged. P (the player) has a choice, either he kills the village with Q, or kills Q himself.</p>
<h1>Gameplay</h1>
<p>The core gameplay is a mix of the base-building mechanics of RTS games like Starcraft and Warcraft 3, and the resource-gathering and villager-development of Stardew Valley. The player gathers resources to build, and upgrade structures. There are 3 resources: wood, silver, &amp; food.</p>
<p>Wood is gathered from the Forest. As the story progresses to the player&rsquo;s madness, visual/audio distortions and illusions may occur. The player may be required to kill villagers for rituals for the machine's completion.</p>
<h2>Combat</h2>
<p>The player can attack with weapons by left clicking. A weapon (ex: sword), will swing from the player.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any entities that touch the weapon sprite will take damage. Enemies may move to dodge attacks.</p>
<p>Enemies attack in the same way as players, except that they have a long windup that leads into a choreographed strike. An example is an enemy winding up an attack from their right, then lunges with the weapon on their right side. This gives the player a chance to not only dodge, but attack from the enemy&rsquo;s left.</p>
<p>The player&rsquo;s health and damage will increase as the player upgrades their village. The enemies will grow in difficulty as the player goes deeper into the woods/forest, and as their sanity diminishes.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Outside: Mining/Foresting</h2>
<p>It is unrealistic to expect both of these to be implemented, however they are mostly just the theme of what is otherwise an outside level to the village. I will call this zone the Outside.</p>
<p>The Outside is where the player gathers resources. Resources spawn in random areas for the player to collect (wood, stone, food, silver, etc). Enemies spawn in the zones and patrol around. Enemies who are near the player will attack them.</p>
<h2>The Village</h2>
<p>The village is the player's initial concern, as it grows in population it will generate more money but also demand more food and other resources. The player can build houses to get more people to move it. Each villager consumes food on a daily basis. The more villagers move in, the more food is required but they generate more wood and silver to make the village expand greater.</p>
