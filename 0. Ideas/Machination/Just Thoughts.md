What happens if you try to kill a villager? Most of them would die in one hit. You can carry the body around? Bring them to the machine and nothing happens, but if you leave them there and nobody sees you do it then something extra happens when it turns on. Maybe if you sacrifice someone, she comes back not evil? Scope monster approaches... ^kill-a-villager


The nobleman is incentivized to pay for new construction because he owns the land and wants to earn taxes from people living on it. ^greedy-nobleman


Maybe you could build things that will allure certain occupations to come to settle down in order to procure certain components if that occupation is not yet present in your town. Examples below. ^allure-occupations

(had to separate this section for the link tag to work)
Possible occupations include:
- Baker
- Farmer
- ~~Watchmaker~~
- Blacksmith
- Priest/Vicar
- Herbalist/Apothecary
- Artisan/Ceramicist
- Scribe
	- What if you have to find a carved runic stone somewhere and have the scribe copy its unreadable writings onto a page or onto a metal part to be used in the machine?


Not sure how deep the dialogue system should go... Writing takes time and the more response options available, the more there is to write and manage. Mr. ChatGPT does indeed exist but man, I'd be very concerned about the quality. Maybe as a starting point? Anyway, it's probably out of scope to have the dialogue seriously effect the game outcomes so idk. This is a discussion for another time. ^dialogue-musings


Current thoughts are that every night, you return home but the camera stays on the outside of the building, while showing a speech bubble for what you say to your wife. This should make sense to the player, as the game never shows the inside of any building. ^every-night


Enemies in the mine... hmmm, something smells like a ConcernedApe in here! I'm not too sure about having enemies at all. It would have to be either in a specific area, like how SV does it (so as not to detract from chill feelings) or be done in a specific and not-too-threatening way, like the opposite of how Factorio does it. Austin's idea of the "Outside" does fit with the former, as long as they're considered secluded areas and enemies can't freely enter the town. Having enemies does provide a new source for components/materials, so that is something to consider. ^enemies


Games are expected to have a fail state... we haven't really considered that. Optional fighting would help keep the game more chill, but then the fail state is only exposed to those who choose to fight. Forced fighting introduces more stress, but maybe that's good? Helps to propel the experience forward. Gotta think more about fail state... ^fail-state


Going with the themes of "occupations" and "personal connections," there could be a cool moment where you have to string together a bunch of quests over time once you have enough occupations - e.g. (botanist, seeds) -> (farmer, wheat) -> (miller, flour) -> (baker, bread) -> (chef, feast) ^string-of-quests


Standard resources are always available. There will always be trees in the forest, rocks in the mines, water in the streams. They are randomly generated and regenerated according to simple timers/noise. ^standard-resources


Special resources have limited availability. Some may only appear in specific locations. Some may only appear at certain times of day. Some may only appear when it is time for the player to find them (according to The List) ^special-resources


~~"The List" is a piece of parchment given to the player near the midpoint of Act 1. It is a component manifest of arcane materials, written by the nobleman, designed to make the machine function as intended. Receipt of The List introduces the mechanic of constructing the machine ^the-list~~
