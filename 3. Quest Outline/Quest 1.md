[[Homework2]]Beginning/tutorial quest to introduce the story and demonstrate game mechanics.

- What triggers the quest start? 
	- The game is started
- Who gives the quest to the player?
	- The opening cutscene, which shows the protagonist unpacking boxes into a newly built shed. He opens a letter from his nobleman employer: 
		"
		My dear friend, 
		
		I hope this letter finds you well. The latest delivery is the last of the resources allotted you to. I hope it is enough for you start the new settlement.
		
		Please remember that this is only enough resources to start your village. I am commissioning you to build a fully self-sufficient village. You will need to gather wood, metal, and food. Silver is also important for acquiring things outside your ability to gather. I am paying you 10 silver for each person who moves into your settlement. 
		
		You will need wood to build houses and town utilities like farms and wells. I am hoping for this settlement to one day be a mining and blacksmithing village; you will need to gather metal to start this venture. There is a few days food stockpiled, make sure to find a consistent source of additional food.
		
		Make sure to get to know the others that were sent along with you. Explore your surroundings, and welcome new travelers as guests and hopefully later as residents. 
		
		May you and your wife stay in good health.
		
		Best wishes, Sir Lancaster of Arrowcreek
