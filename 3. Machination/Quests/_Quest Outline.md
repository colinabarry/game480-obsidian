The player is given quests that take the player through the game’s narrative with the overarching goal of completing and powering on a machine to heal P’s wife. Each quest contains multiple objectives that they will do over several in-game days. When the conditions for one quest are complete, the player is given the next quest when they wake up the next day in the form of a letter from the Nobleman.

The following section describes the 10 quests that make up the game, with the quest’s machine component and all quest tasks and sub-tasks specified in nested list form.
