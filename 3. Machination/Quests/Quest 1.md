Beginning/tutorial quest to introduce the story and demonstrate game mechanics.

## What triggers the quest start? 
The game is started.
## Who gives the quest to the player?
In the opening cutscene, the protagonist is shown unpacking bags into a freshly pitched tent. He opens a letter from his nobleman employer: 

<blockquote>
<i>
<h1><i>"</i></h1>
My dear friend, 
<br><br>
I hope this letter finds you well. The latest delivery is the last of the resources allotted you to. I hope it is enough for you start the new settlement.
<br><br>
Please remember that this is only enough resources to start your village. I am commissioning you to build a fully self-sufficient village. You will need to gather wood, metal, and food. Silver is also important for acquiring things outside your ability to gather. I am paying you 10 silver for each person who moves into your settlement. 
<br><br>
You will need wood to build houses and town utilities like farms and wells. I am hoping for this settlement to one day be a mining and blacksmithing village; you will need to gather metal to start this venture. There is a few days food stockpiled, make sure to find a consistent source of additional food.
<br><br>
Make sure to get to know the others that were sent along with you. Explore your surroundings, and welcome new travelers as guests and hopefully later as residents. 
<br><br>
May you and your wife stay in good health.
<br><br>
Best wishes, <br>
