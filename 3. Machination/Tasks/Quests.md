## Notes
The game is split into 10 chapters, each corresponding to a component of the machine that you must find or create. Each chapter contains several "interactions", some of which are optional, one of which leads to receiving the component. The interaction which leads to collecting a component will be labeled as a key (🗝️) interaction.
