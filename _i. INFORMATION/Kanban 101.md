- List items are ***actionable tasks***, not ideas
- Ideas go in the "Ideas" folder
    - Could be a note, a canvas, a drawing, etc
    - Ideas spanning more than one file should be placed in a sub-folder
- New items start in "Backlog," the group decides final categories
- Always ***KISS*** your homies
- Move items you complete into "To Review" for group review at the next meeting.
